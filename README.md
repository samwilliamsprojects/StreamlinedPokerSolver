# StreamlinedPokerSolver
Tools added outside of an open-source Poker solver (https://github.com/bupticybee/TexasSolver) for easier use

# To run the solver:
Edit the "input.txt" file in the TexasSolver directory to match your hand. Then run 

./run_solver.sh

My scripts only work for the flop right now, but will extend to the turn and the river in the future.
